<h1>Time and Space Complexity</h1>

    <p>
        Time Complexity refers to how the execution time of an algorithm increases as the input size grows. It helps in analyzing the efficiency of an algorithm.
    </p>

    <p>
        <b>Space Complexity</b> refers to the amount of memory an algorithm requires to run relative to the input size. It is often represented in Big-O notation, such as O(n).

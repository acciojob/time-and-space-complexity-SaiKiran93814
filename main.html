	 <h1>Understanding Time and Space Complexity</h1>

    <p>
        Time Complexity refers to the computational complexity 
		that describes the amount of time an algorithm takes 
		to run as a function of the length of the input. 
		It helps in determining how efficient an algorithm is in terms of execution time.
    </p>

    <p>
        <b>Space Complexity</b> refers to the total amount of memory space required by an algorithm,
		including both the input data storage and auxiliary storage.
		It is commonly expressed using Big-O notation, such as O(n),
		to represent the growth rate of memory usage relative to the input size.

<h1>Time and Space Complexity</h1>
<p>Time complexity is understood as the time taken by a program to run and  complete the guven task.
          As a programmer,your goal should be reduce the time complexity of the code by optimizing it and make it more efficient.</p>
	<p> <b>Space complexity</b></p> is a related to the amout of memory occupied by the program.For exampl, if a program takes an array of size n as input,the space complexity of the program become O(n)
